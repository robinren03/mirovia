# Mirovia

* increased upper bound on DeviceMemory problem size
* added doHalf (half precision FLOP test) to MaxFlops

### Run file plans

* generated by a master script:
  * run file per benchmark
    * writes results to std out
    * maybe add an option to just output time?
  * run file for the entire suite
    * writes results to results folder
    * writes times to std out
  * looks at:
    * device capabilities: determines problem size created by datagen
    * cuda version: determines how certain benchmarks are run (cuda version also determines how it compiles, and this should be a separate step in the makefile I think)
