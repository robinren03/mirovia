src/cuda/common/main.cpp
- added -outfile option to write benchmark results to a file instead of stdout
- changed the output from ResultDatabase.DumpDetailed to ResultDatabase.DumpSummary

src/cuda/level0/MaxFlops/DeviceMemory.cu
- when testing device memory capabilities, increased max size to 1GB (from 64MB)

src/cuda/level0/MaxFlops/MaxFlops.cu
- added if statement to see if compute capability supports half-precision operations
- if so, run half precision tests using <short>
- renamed tests so the type of precision is at the beginning of the name

driver.py
- can specify options
    - prefix
    - problem size
    - device
    - benchmarks
- runs all or subset of benchmarks
